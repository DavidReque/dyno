# Pagination

The **Pagination** component allows users to navigate between different content pages using navigation buttons. This is especially useful for interfaces that require pagination, where a portion of the total content is displayed and users are allowed to change pages intuitively.

## Features

- **Navigation between pages:** Allows changing the active page.
- **Internal state management:** Integrates with the application state to update the current page.
- **Centered design:** Adapts to different layouts and resolutions.
- **Interaction through events:** Notifies through a callback each time the page is changed so the state can be updated externally.

## Usage

To use the component, it is necessary to manage the current page state and update it through the `onPageChange` function. Below is an example of how to implement the component:

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Pagination from "@your-package/components/General/Pagination/Pagination";

const Example = () => {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);

  return (
    <Pagination
      totalPages={5}
      currentPage={currentPage}
      onPageChange={(page) => setCurrentPage(page)}
    />
  );
};

export default Example;
```

## Examples

### Default Accordion

<Story of={PaginationStories.Default} />
